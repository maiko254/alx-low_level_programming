Task 0: 0-binary_to_uint - Write a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.  
* Prototype: `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`
* where `b` is pointing to a string of `0` and `1` chars
* Return: the converted number, or 0 if 
  * there is one or more chars in the string b that is not `0` or `1`
